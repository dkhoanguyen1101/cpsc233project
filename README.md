To run the program, move all classes in the desired branch to a preferred editor (e.g. eclipse) and run the “Game.java” class. 

Our game is a turn-based rpg. This demo is controlled completely by the mouse, and the goal of the game is to lower the all of the enemies health to zero, while keeping your own team healthy.

The game takes place on a sixteen by sixteen space game board. To move characters, click on the character you want to move and click where you would like them to go. All other actions are controlled by the labeled buttons located in the lower left side of the GUI.

For each turn: 

Each character will be given the option to move or stay put, as well as either attack, use an item, use their special ability, or do nothing. 
 
Attacking: if you are within attack range of your opponent, you can attack your opponent, and their health will go down. If you are out of this range, you cannot attack. 
 
Using Items: you will be shown your characters inventory, and allowed to select an item, upon which the selected item will be used up and unavailable for the rest of the game. Each character starts with one health potion in this demo, which will raise their health by 50. 

Using Specials: each character has a mana gauge. If this gauge is full enough, your characters will be able to use their special moves. These special moves vary in what they do, such as healing an ally, or doing a bunch of damage. 
 
After you have made your move, the opponent will choose where to move, and try to attack your team of characters. 
 
After this, the turn order will then restart, and this will continue until either all of the player characters health or all of the enemies health reaches zero. 
 
When this happens, you will either move to a new room, or you will have won the game.
